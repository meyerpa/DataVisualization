This interactive visualization compares programming language speeds. The data is from [Gouy, Isaac at The Computer Language Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/). Notice that some of the programming languages have memory errors when doing certain tests.
The tests include:
+ [*n-body*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/nbody-description.html#nbody): Model the orbits of Jovian planets, using the same simple symplectic-integrator.
+ [*spectral-norm*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/spectralnorm-description.html#spectralnorm): calculates the spectral norm of an infinite matrix A, with entries a~11~=1, a~12~=1/2, a~21~=1/3, a~13~=1/4, a~22~=1/5, a~31~=1/6, etc. For more information on this problem, see [Wolfram's Hundred Dollar Digit Problem #3](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hundred-DollarHundred-DigitChallengeProblems.html).
+ [*pidigits*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/pidigits-description.html#pidigits): Here, the program calculated the first N digits of pi, printed 10 digits per line with N=27 then N=10,000.
+ [*fannkuch-redux*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/fannkuchredux-description.html#fannkuchredux): program takes a list {3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7}, looks at the first number (3) in the list and flips the (3) elements in the list and repeats until the first element is a 1, keeping track of the number of flips. This program does this for all 7! permutations of the list and returns the largest number of flips. Side note: fannkuch is short for the German word, Pfannkuch, or pancakes which is analogous to this program.
+ [*reverse complement*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/revcomp-description.html#revcomp): by knowing the sequence of bases of one strand of DNA we immediately know the sequence of the DNA strand which will bind to it, this strand is called the reverse complement. This program reads in codes, and outputs the reverse-complement.
+ [*k-nucleotide*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/knucleotide.html): This program reads in a file, extracts the DNA sequence, updates a hashtable with each DNA sequence, and counts all of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 18-nucleotide sequences.
+ [*fasta*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/fasta-description.html#fasta): This program generates DNA sequences by copying from a given sequence, and generates the DNA sequences with a weighted random selection from 2 alphabets.
+ [*binary-trees*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/binarytrees-description.html#binarytrees): This program creates perfect binary trees
+ [*mandelbrot*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/mandelbrot-description.html#mandelbrot): This program plots the Mandelbrot set [-1.5i, 0.5i]  on an N-by-N bitmap.
+ [*regex-redux*](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/regexredux.html): This program uses regex to match and replace specified sequences, all linefeed characters, and records the sequence length.
