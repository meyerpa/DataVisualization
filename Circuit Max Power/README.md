This visualization shows a simple circuit, a battery connection to a resistor, connection to a load with a resistance. We wan tot find the load resistance that will maximize the power through the load. This can be done by manipulating Ohm's Law equations, and some math. But say if we don't have the exact resistance to maximize the power through the load, this program also shows other resistance's power through the load. The battery and resistance can be changed to fit your needs.
